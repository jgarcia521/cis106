# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes 

 ## What is an Operating System?
    It provides all fundamental software features of a computer. It also enables you to use the computers hardware providing you the basic tools that make the computer useful. 
 ## What is a kernel?
   It is a software component that is responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware, memory allocation, CPU time, and program to program interaction.
 ## Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?
The other parts that identifies as an OS is command- line shells, graphical user interfaces, utility and productivity program, and libraries. 
  ## What is linux?
   It is an operating system thats popular is academic and business environments it consist of kernel, libraries and utilities.
 ## What is a linux distribution?
   It is any operating system that runs the Linux Kernel.
 ## List at least 4 linux characteristics:
   * Free of charge to use
   * It includes many of the Unix tools including many important internet server programs and programming languages out the box.
   * highly scalable and customizable.
   * Many businesses and nonprofit organizations rely on Linux for their day to day operations.
  ## What is Ubuntu?
   It is also a Linux distribution, freely available with both community and professional support.
   ## What is Debian?
   It is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software and promoting the ideals of the Free Software community.
   ## List and define the different types of licensing agreements
   * Open source- the software may be distributed for fee or free, the source code is distributed with the software.
   * Closed source- the software is not distributed with the source code, the user is restricted from modifying the code. 
   * Freeware- the software is free but the source code is not available. 
   * Shareware- the software is free on a trial basis.
   * Free software- the software is distributed with the source code, the software can be free of charge or obatained by a fee.
  ## What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
  A free software is a critical force in the open source world.
   1. Freedom 0- use the software for any purpose.
   2. Freedom 1- examine the source code and modify it as you see fit.
   3. Freedom 2- redistribute the software.
   4. Freedom 3- redistribute your modified software
  ## What is virtualization?
  It is defined as creating virtual versions of something. 
  ## List 3 benefits of virtualization
  1. Allows running multiple OSs on one machine without dual booting.
  2. Allows applications to be tested before installing them on a host machine.
  3. Reduces the cost by decreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network. 
  ## What is a hypervisor? Include definitions of the 2 types
  It is a software pr hardware in charge of creating, managing, and running virtual machines.
  1. type 1 (bare-metal hypervisor)- runs directly on the hardware and has better performance that Type 2. 
  2. type 2- an application that runs on top of an operating system. The most commonly used in client-side virtualization.
  ## What is the difference between Guest OS and Host OS?
  Host OS- it is running in the computer where the hypervisor is installed.
  Guest OS- it is being virtualized in the virtual machine.
 ## What is virtualbox?
 It is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virutalization product for enterpirse as well as home use.
